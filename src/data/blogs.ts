const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'dbuser',
  host: 'database.server.com',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'secretpassword',
  port: 5432,
  max: 20, // max number of clients in the pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
\`\`\`

#### Indexing for Performance
- Create indexes on frequently queried fields
- Use compound indexes for multi-field queries
- Monitor query performance regularly
- Consider NoSQL alternatives for specific use cases

### 4. Caching Strategies

#### Redis Caching Example

\`\`\`typescript
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');

const app = express();
const client = redis.createClient();

// Middleware to check cache
const checkCache = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  client.get(id, (err: Error | null, data: string | null) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    if (data !== null) {
      res.send(JSON.parse(data));
    } else {
      next();
    }
  });
};

// Route with caching
app.get('/api/items/:id', checkCache, async (req: any, res: any) => {
  try {
    const item = await db.findItemById(req.params.id);
    client.setex(req.params.id, 3600, JSON.stringify(item));
    res.json(item);
  } catch (err: any) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});
\`\`\`

### 5. Security Best Practices

> "Hooks are a more direct way to use the React features you already know." - React Documentation

At BorangiLABS, we've built our reputation on delivering cutting-edge web applications, and React has been at the core of our frontend development stack for years. One of the most significant shifts we've embraced is the adoption of React Hooks, which have fundamentally transformed how we build components.

In 2025, Hooks aren't just an alternative—they're the standard for modern React development. Our team has extensively used Hooks in projects ranging from enterprise applications to e-commerce platforms, and we've seen firsthand how they can dramatically improve code quality and developer productivity.

In this comprehensive guide, our development team shares the collective knowledge we've gained from implementing Hooks in production environments.

## 1. What Are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features from function components.

Before hooks, developers had to use class components to manage state or lifecycle methods like componentDidMount. Now, with hooks, function components can do everything class components can—more simply.

## 2. The Most Commonly Used React Hooks

Let's start with the basics.

### a) useState – Managing Local State

The simplest and most used hook. It allows you to add state variables to functional components.

\`\`\`jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

✅ **Cleaner than a class-based this.state**  
✅ **Supports multiple state variables** in one component

### b) useEffect – Side Effects

This hook handles side effects like fetching data, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

\`\`\`jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((json) => setData(json));
  }, []); // empty array means run once (componentDidMount)

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(post => <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
\`\`\`

✅ **Equivalent** to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined  
✅ **Dependency array** controls when it runs

### c) useContext – Consuming Context Easily

Instead of passing props down multiple levels, useContext makes it easy to access values from a Context Provider.

\`\`\`jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by {theme}</button>;
}
\`\`\`

### d) useRef – Accessing DOM & Persisting Values

useRef gives you a way to directly reference DOM elements or store a mutable value that doesn't trigger re-renders.

\`\`\`jsx
import { useRef } from "react";

function FocusInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={focus}>Focus Input</button>
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### e) useReducer – For Complex State Logic

When state logic becomes too complicated for useState, useReducer is the answer. It's like Redux-lite inside your component.

\`\`\`jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <>
      <p>{state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## 3. Advanced React Hooks

### a) useMemo – Optimizing Performance

Memoizes values so expensive computations don't run unnecessarily.

\`\`\`jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
\`\`\`

### b) useCallback – Memoizing Functions

Ensures functions aren't recreated on every render. Useful when passing callbacks to child components.

\`\`\`jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
\`\`\`

### c) Custom Hooks

You can build your own hooks to reuse logic across multiple components.

\`\`\`jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return width;
}
\`\`\`

## 4. Common Mistakes with Hooks

❌ **Forgetting dependency arrays** in useEffect → causes infinite loops  
❌ **Calling hooks inside conditionals/loops** → hooks must always run in the same order  
❌ **Overusing useState** where useReducer is better  
❌ **Forgetting cleanup** in useEffect → memory leaks

## 5. Why Hooks Are the Future

Hooks are not just a convenience—they are a paradigm shift:

- ✅ **Encourage functional programming** style
- ✅ Make code **reusable and cleaner**
- ✅ Improve **performance** with memoization tools
- ✅ Reduce reliance on external state management libraries

## Final Thoughts from Our Team

After implementing Hooks in numerous projects, from enterprise applications to dynamic web portals, we can confidently say that mastering React Hooks is non-negotiable for modern web development in 2025. Our team has seen significant improvements in code maintainability, component reusability, and application performance since fully adopting Hooks.

At BorangiLABS, we've successfully leveraged Hooks to build scalable solutions for clients across various industries, including telecommunications, e-commerce, and financial services. The consistency and predictability that Hooks bring to our codebase have been game-changers for our development workflow.

💡 **Pro Tip from Our Developers:** When implementing Hooks in large-scale applications, we recommend creating a dedicated \`hooks\` directory for your custom hooks. This practice has helped our team maintain clean, organized, and reusable code across projects.

    title: 'The Power of TypeScript: Why It\'s Shaping the Future of Software Development',
    excerpt: 'Discover how TypeScript is revolutionizing JavaScript development with type safety, better tooling, and improved maintainability for large-scale applications.',
    content: `*By Erick Okioma | March 15, 2025 | 12 min read*

In the ever-evolving world of software development, one language has consistently risen above the noise in recent years: TypeScript.

Originally developed by Microsoft, TypeScript started as a small addition to JavaScript. Today, it has become the de facto standard for large-scale web applications, powering frameworks like Angular, Next.js, NestJS, and even parts of React ecosystems.

But what makes TypeScript so powerful? And why should developers and businesses in 2025 pay attention to it?

## 1. What is TypeScript?

At its core, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

It adds static typing and type safety to JavaScript.

It compiles back into plain JavaScript that runs anywhere JS does (browsers, Node.js, servers).

It brings the best of both worlds: the flexibility of JavaScript and the reliability of strongly typed languages like Java or C#.

Think of it this way:
👉 JavaScript is like building a house without a blueprint. You can get it done, but mistakes are easy to make.
👉 TypeScript gives you the blueprint—it catches problems before you build.

## 2. Why TypeScript Matters for Developers

### a) Fewer Bugs, More Confidence

TypeScript's type system prevents common mistakes like passing the wrong data type, calling undefined functions, or accessing missing properties.

\`\`\`typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}\`;
}

greet("Erick"); // ✅ works
greet(42); // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
\`\`\`

These safeguards save hours of debugging time.

### b) Better Developer Experience

Features like autocompletion, refactoring tools, and error hints make developers faster and happier.

In VS Code (built by Microsoft, optimized for TS), developers get intelligent suggestions as they code—reducing mistakes and boosting productivity.

### c) Scales with Your Codebase

For small scripts, plain JavaScript works fine. But when your code grows to thousands of lines (think: ISP management dashboards, e-learning apps, or marketplaces), TypeScript keeps things organized.

## 3. Why TypeScript Matters for Businesses

### a) Faster Development Cycles

Bugs are caught at compile time, not in production.

Developers spend less time firefighting and more time innovating.

### b) Easier Onboarding for Teams

With type definitions, new developers can understand code faster.

For example, instead of wondering what a function expects, the type signature tells them directly:

\`\`\`typescript
function calculateBill(amount: number, taxRate: number): number;
\`\`\`

### c) Stronger Software Quality

Clients trust software that doesn't break easily. By adopting TypeScript, businesses reduce downtime, improve user satisfaction, and save costs on bug fixes.

## 4. TypeScript in Action

### a) Frontend Development

React + TypeScript is now one of the most popular stacks worldwide. It ensures UI components are predictable and maintainable.

\`\`\`typescript
type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
};

function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}
\`\`\`

### b) Backend Development

Frameworks like NestJS are built around TypeScript, giving Node.js apps structure and reliability.

\`\`\`typescript
@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return "This returns all users";
  }
}
\`\`\`

### c) API Contracts

With TypeScript, you can define clear contracts between frontend and backend. No more guessing what data to expect.

## 5. The TypeScript Ecosystem

- **DefinitelyTyped**: thousands of type definitions for third-party libraries
- **TS-Node**: run TS directly without compilation
- **Deno**: a secure runtime for TS/JS by the creator of Node.js
- **Next.js 14+**: first-class TypeScript support out of the box

## 6. Common Criticisms of TypeScript (and Why They Don't Hold Up)

- **"It slows me down"** → Once you get used to it, it actually speeds up development.
- **"It's too strict"** → You can use gradual typing. Start with JS, then add TS where it matters.
- **"Small projects don't need it"** → True, but small projects often grow unexpectedly. Starting with TS saves pain later.

## 7. The Future of TypeScript

In 2025, TypeScript is not a "nice-to-have"—it's an industry best practice.

Companies like Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, and Shopify rely on it.

AI tools (like GitHub Copilot) are optimized for TypeScript, giving developers even more productivity.

Open-source frameworks are increasingly built with TypeScript at their core.

For Kenyan developers and startups (like BorangiLABS), adopting TypeScript means staying competitive globally.

## Final Thoughts

TypeScript empowers developers to write cleaner, safer, and more scalable code. It bridges the gap between flexibility and reliability—something every modern business needs.

At BorangiLABS, we embrace TypeScript across projects, whether building SaaS platforms, ISP management systems, or AI-driven applications.

If your business wants future-proof technology, the power of TypeScript is non-negotiable.

## What is Docker? A 2025 Perspective

Docker is an open-source platform that packages applications into standardized units called containers. These containers bundle everything needed to run an application:

- **Application Code** - Your software and its components
- **Runtime** - All necessary executables and libraries
- **System Tools** - System libraries and settings
- **Configuration** - Environment-specific settings and variables

### How Docker Solves Real-World Problems

1. **Environment Consistency** - Eliminates "works on my machine" issues
2. **Rapid Deployment** - Containers start in seconds vs. minutes for VMs
3. **Resource Efficiency** - Shares the host OS kernel, using fewer resources
4. **Version Control** - Track changes to your container environments
5. **Isolation** - Applications run in isolated environments

## Getting Started with Docker in 2025

## Docker Core Concepts

### 1. Docker Images

Docker images are read-only templates containing application code and dependencies. They serve as the blueprint for containers.

**Key Commands:**
\`\`\`bash
# List downloaded images
docker images

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx:latest

# Remove an image
docker rmi nginx

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
\`\`\`

### 2. Docker Containers

Containers are runnable instances of Docker images. They're lightweight, portable, and isolated environments.

**Key Commands:**
\`\`\`bash
# Run a container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop my-nginx

# Remove a container
docker rm my-nginx

# View container logs
docker logs my-nginx

# Execute a command in a running container
docker exec -it my-nginx bash
\`\`\`

### 3. Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies multi-container application management using YAML files.

**docker-compose.yml Example:**
\`\`\`yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
\`\`\`

**Key Commands:**
\`\`\`bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
\`\`\`

## Advanced Docker Features in 2025

### 1. Docker BuildKit

The next-generation build engine with improved performance and security features.

**Enable BuildKit:**
\`\`\`bash
# Set environment variable
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

# Or use the --progress flag
docker build --progress=plain -t myapp .
\`\`\`

### 2. Multi-Stage Builds

Optimize your Docker images by using multi-stage builds to reduce final image size.

**Example:**
\`\`\`dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
\`\`\`

### 3. Docker Volumes and Storage

Persist data between container restarts using volumes.

**Key Commands:**
\`\`\`bash
# Create a volume
docker volume create myvolume

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Use a volume in a container
docker run -v myvolume:/data nginx

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune
\`\`\`

If you're asking: "Why is my WiFi so slow?" — this comprehensive guide will explain the top causes and how to fix them quickly in 2025.

## Common Reasons Why Your WiFi is Slow in Kenya

### 1. Too Many Devices Connected 📱💻

Each device connected to your router uses bandwidth. In today's smart homes, it's common to have multiple devices connected simultaneously:
- Smartphones (2-4 per household)
- Laptops and tablets
- Smart TVs and streaming devices
- Smart home devices (cameras, assistants, etc.)
- Gaming consoles

**Fix:** 
- Limit connected devices to essential ones only
- Disconnect devices not in use
- Consider upgrading to a higher bandwidth plan with your ISP
- Use BorangiISP's device management feature to prioritize critical devices

### 2. Weak WiFi Signal Strength 📶

WiFi signals weaken with distance and physical barriers. In Kenya's urban areas with concrete buildings, this is a common issue.

**Signal Killers:**
- Thick walls (especially concrete)
- Distance from router
- Electronic interference (microwaves, cordless phones)
- Metal objects and mirrors

**Fix:**
- **Optimal Router Placement**: Central location, elevated position
- **WiFi Extenders**: For large homes (2000+ sq ft)
- **Mesh Network**: Best for multi-story buildings
- **Powerline Adapters**: Uses electrical wiring to extend network

### 3. Outdated Router or Firmware 🛠️

Technology evolves rapidly. A router from 2020 might not support today's WiFi standards.

**Router Standards Comparison:**
- WiFi 4 (802.11n) - Up to 600Mbps
- WiFi 5 (802.11ac) - Up to 3.5Gbps
- WiFi 6 (802.11ax) - Up to 9.6Gbps
- WiFi 6E - Latest standard with 6GHz band

**Fix:**
- Upgrade to at least WiFi 6 router
- Check for firmware updates monthly
- Consider ISP-provided routers with latest standards

### 4. Bandwidth Hogging Applications 🎮📺

Modern applications consume significant bandwidth:
- 4K/8K video streaming (Netflix, YouTube)
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams)
- Cloud gaming (Xbox Cloud, GeForce Now)
- Large file downloads/backups

**Fix:**
- Schedule large downloads during off-peak hours (12 AM - 6 AM)
- Enable Quality of Service (QoS) in router settings
- Set bandwidth limits for non-essential devices
- Upgrade to BorangiISP's business plan for guaranteed bandwidth

### 5. Internet Service Provider (ISP) Issues 🌐

Sometimes the problem lies with your Internet Service Provider.

**Common ISP Issues:**
- Network congestion during peak hours
- Infrastructure limitations
- Bandwidth throttling
- Outdated local infrastructure

**Fix:**
- Run speed tests at different times using [BorangiISP Speed Test](https://isp.borangi.co.ke/speedtest)
- Compare with your subscribed plan
- Contact BorangiISP support for line quality checks
- Consider upgrading to fiber-optic if available

### 6. WiFi Interference and Channel Congestion 📡

In urban Kenyan neighborhoods, multiple WiFi networks can interfere with each other.

**Interference Sources:**
- Neighboring WiFi networks
- Bluetooth devices
- Baby monitors
- Microwave ovens
- Wireless security cameras

**Fix:**
- Use WiFi analyzer apps to find less crowded channels
- Switch to 5GHz band (less congestion, shorter range)
- Update to WiFi 6E for 6GHz band (less interference)
- Position router away from other electronics

### 7. Security Threats and Unauthorized Access 🛡️

Unsecured networks can be exploited by unauthorized users.

**Risks:**
- Bandwidth theft
- Data interception
- Malware distribution
- Illegal activities traced back to your IP

**Fix:**
- Use WPA3 encryption (or at least WPA2)
- Create a strong, unique password
- Enable network encryption
- Set up a guest network for visitors
- Regularly check connected devices in router admin panel

    excerpt: 'Discover how digital POS systems are revolutionizing small retail businesses across Kenya with improved efficiency and sales tracking.',
    content: `## Introduction

Running a small shop in Kenya used to mean pen-and-paper accounting, guesswork in inventory, and long manual end-of-day reconciliations. But today, more shop owners are embracing Point of Sale (POS) systems to simplify operations and improve profits.

In this guide, we'll break down:
- What a POS system is
- Why small shops in Kenya are adopting POS solutions
- Key benefits (with real-world examples)
- Features to look for in a POS
- How POS systems are shaping the future of retail in Kenya

## What is a POS System?

A POS (Point of Sale) system is software (and sometimes hardware) that helps businesses manage:
- Sales & payments
- Inventory tracking
- Customer data
- Reports & analytics

For small shops in Kenya, this often means using a cloud-based POS app on a tablet, smartphone, or simple desktop setup.

## Why Small Shops in Kenya Are Switching to POS Systems

Traditionally, duka owners (small retailers) relied on cashbooks and receipts. But challenges like stockouts, theft, and poor record-keeping pushed many to modern solutions.

Today, POS adoption is growing because:
- Smartphones are affordable
- Internet access is more widespread
- Local companies like BorangiPOS are offering affordable POS packages
- Shop owners want better financial visibility

## Benefits of POS Systems for Small Shops

### 1. Accurate Inventory Management
POS systems update stock levels automatically when sales are made.

👉 No more "stock guesswork" — shopkeepers instantly know which products need restocking.

### 2. Faster & Smarter Sales Tracking
Instead of flipping through receipts, owners can check daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports instantly.

### 3. Reduced Theft and Loss
Every transaction is recorded digitally. Employees can't easily manipulate sales figures, reducing internal losses.

### 4. Customer Loyalty Programs
Some POS systems allow shops to save customer details and offer discounts, credits, or loyalty rewards.

### 5. Integration with Mobile Money (M-Pesa)
Modern POS systems integrate with M-Pesa, making cashless payments seamless for customers.

### 6. Tax Compliance Made Easy
POS systems generate proper invoices, helping SMEs stay compliant with Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) requirements.

## Features Every Shop in Kenya Should Look for in a POS

When choosing a POS system, shop owners should prioritize:

✅ Offline & Online Support (works even without internet)

✅ Multi-User Access (for staff management)

✅ Real-Time Inventory Tracking

✅ M-Pesa Integration (till or paybill)

✅ Simple Reporting Dashboards

✅ Affordability & Scalability

## Case Study: A Small Shop in Nairobi

A grocery shop in Kayole switched from manual cashbooks to a cloud POS system. Within 6 months:
- Stockouts reduced by 40%
- Daily sales reports helped the owner identify best-selling products
- Employee theft dropped significantly because every sale was logged
- Customers appreciated faster checkout and M-Pesa payments

## How Much Does a POS System Cost in Kenya?

Prices vary depending on provider and features:
- Basic POS apps (for small dukas) – as low as KES 500–1,500 per month
- Advanced POS systems (multi-branch shops, supermarkets) – from KES 5,000+ per month

Some vendors offer one-time payment licenses, but cloud-based subscription models are becoming more popular.

👉 For small shops, BorangiPOS offers affordable, tailored solutions.

## The Future of POS in Kenya

Looking ahead, POS systems will continue evolving with:
- AI-driven sales forecasting
- Mobile-first POS apps for Android & iOS
- Deeper integration with e-commerce platforms
- Enhanced security & compliance features for KRA eTIMS

## Conclusion

POS systems are no longer a luxury — they are a necessity for small shops in Kenya. By streamlining sales, managing inventory, and integrating with M-Pesa, POS solutions are helping dukas grow into sustainable, profitable businesses.

At BorangiLABS, we specialize in building custom POS systems designed for the Kenyan retail market.
